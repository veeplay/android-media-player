1.9.9
=====
- Added a metadata field (HashMap<String, Object>) for APSVastAdbreak object (should be constructed before usage). If used, it will add any keys set to the metadata of each APSMediaUnit generated by the adbreak object
- APSMediaPlayer._overlaysDisplayed is now a public field
- Unit metadata keys now contain integers exclusively for determining the offset. The values for prerolls and postrolls are static (0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE)

1.9.8
=====
- Modified the onTrackingReceived header, it now only accepts two parameters: MediaEventType type and Bundle additionalInfo. The additionalInfo bundle contains by default the old parameters received by onTrackingReceived, on the "urls" and "description" keys.
- Added the CLOCK_TICK event, an event that is fired every second the player is active.
- Added two keys to the additionalInfo Bundle for the CLOCK_TICK event: "position" and "duration", containing two integers (the current position in seconds, and the current content duration, in milliseconds)
- Added two events for detecting user interaction for pausing and resuming playback. The two events are USER_PAUSE and USER_UNPAUSE and are triggered by interacting with the pause button in the controls overlay
- Fixed detecting the content position an adbreak has started at. Each ad content unit contains a metadata key called "aps_vast_adbreak_offset" that holds the offset the ad break has actually started at.

1.9.7
=====
- Bugfix for statically positioned midrolls
- Bugfix for detecting playback state after seek (the player always returned false)

1.9.6
=====
- Added a bugfix for a crash during player finish
- Added seek handling support: by default, the player will only play the last scheduled adbreak, when seeking. This can be configured via the APSMediaUnit#seekHandling field, or using the JSON configuration, on the content unit: "seekAdHandling": "last" (/first/all)
- Added automatic ad breaks positioning: a minimum initial offset, minimum final offset and minimum interval between ad-breaks can be set (all default to 300 seconds). Ad breaks that are not configured with an offset will be automatically scheduled based on these three parameters.
- Added the FORWARD event, for detecting forward seeks
- The SurfaceView is now secure, by default, on devices with API level > 17. This behaviour can be changed by calling APSMediaPlayer#setSecureSurfaceView(false) before initializing the player.

1.9.5
=====
- Added unit and overlay metadata keys for current adbreak offset
- Unit metadata is now copied for unit clones

1.9.4
=====
- Added a bugfix preventing seeking past the end of a video unit
- Added the PLAYLIST_FINISHED trackable event for detecting the end of the playback of the last unit in the playlist

- APSMediaBuilder#mediaUnits and APSMediaPlayer#playMediaUnits now accept ArrayList<APSMediaEvent>

- Fixed a bug where controls were not shown when building an APSMediaUnit instance and not setting an autohide duration

1.8.4
